                    I‚Äôm currently a student and work part-time as a cashier. <span class="highlight">I started coding
                        when I was 12 years old</span> in school, learning Scratch in IT classes, and I‚Äôve been hooked
                    ever since, picking up a lot along the way.

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">I hold a professional qualification</span> in website, web application, and

                    running my community, improving my skills, or just hanging out with friends.

                    Im not part of any big company or organization, so I don't have big popular projects to show off.
                    But I do have some small projects that I created in my free time or for fun.

                <h3>
                    Its small discord community that I created in 2019 when I was just 14 years old and develop it until
                    now, which has grown to almost 100 members so far. Yeah, not much but main invinte link was used
                    over 900 times, so I hope that memer count will grow in the future.<br>
                    <br>I also created a website for it, which is not so advanced, but it works and looks good. You can
                    find it at <a href="https://nnamesquad.top" target="_blank"
                        style="color: var(--nns);">nnamesquad.top</a> or just join the <a

                    FlagBar is a browser extension that adds colors of LGBT-flags to YouTube, making it more
                    personalized and visually appealing. It‚Äôs a fun little project I‚Äôve been working on, and you can
                    check it out at <a href="https://flagbar.nnamesquad.top" target="_blank"

                    <br>Whant to ask why I created it? Well, I was bored and wanted to do something with my free time,
                    and this idea come to my mind because of one of my friends who is coneccted with LGBT community and
                    I wanted to do something for them, but when I started working on it, I realized that it can be
                    useful for everyone, so I decided to make it public and share it with the world.
