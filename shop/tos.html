          <h2 style="color: palevioletred;">üìå Please read carefully before purchasing:</h2>
          <p>
            I act solely as a <strong>third-party reseller</strong> and offer the
            product in its current condition (‚Äú<strong>as is</strong>‚Äù). I am
            <strong>not an official distributor, manufacturer, or representative</strong>
            of any brand or supplier, and cannot guarantee authenticity, original
            packaging, or manufacturer warranties. All purchases are made at the buyer‚Äôs
            own discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do <strong>not provide refunds, returns, or exchanges</strong> under any
            circumstances, <strong>except</strong> in the case where I am
            <strong>personally unable to ship the product at all due to my direct
              fault</strong>
            (e.g., shipping to the wrong address, product unavailable). I am
            <strong>not liable</strong> for damage, loss, or delays caused by the
            delivery service provider, customs, or other third parties, nor for issues
            resulting from
            <strong>incorrect, incomplete, or delayed buyer-provided information</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Product images are provided
            <strong>for illustrative purposes only</strong> ‚Äî the actual item may differ
            in design, packaging, color, or included accessories.
          </p>

          <h3 style="color: wheat; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">üõí Payment, Reservation & Finalization</h3>
          <p>
            Please note that <strong>payment does not finalize the transaction</strong>,
            but instead acts as a
            <strong>100% advance payment and temporary reservation</strong> of the
            selected item(s). The order is considered completed
            <strong>only after</strong> the item has been successfully dispatched.
          </p>
          <p>
            To complete the purchase, the buyer must
            <strong>contact me directly</strong> (via
            <em>Discord or Instagram</em> (check ‚ÄúContact‚Äù tab) as
            stated in the post-purchase instructions) and provide the required delivery
            information ‚Äî including the
            <strong>recipient's full name, address, contact details</strong>, and any
            other relevant data.
          </p>
          <p>
            These instructions are clearly displayed
            <strong>after the purchase is completed</strong>, and also available in the
            <strong>product description</strong> and/or <strong>my profile bio</strong>.
            <strong>It is the buyer‚Äôs responsibility to read and follow them.</strong>
          </p>

          <h3 style="color: wheat; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">‚è≥ Deadline for Providing Delivery Details</h3>
          <p>
            The buyer must provide the required delivery information
            <strong>no later than the end of the third calendar day following the day after
              payment is made</strong>.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <em>(For example: if the payment is completed on
              <strong>Sunday at 13:00</strong>, the buyer has until
              <strong>Wednesday at 23:59</strong> to submit the delivery details.)</em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            If the buyer fails to provide the necessary information within this
            timeframe, it will be considered a
            <strong>voluntary withdrawal from the purchase</strong>. In such case:
          </p>
          <ul>

            <p><strong>No refund will be issued</strong> (the payment will be retained as a cancellation and reservation
              fee),
              <br>The previously reserved item(s) will be <strong>released back for sale</strong>.
            </p>

          </ul>

          <h3 style="color: wheat; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;">üöö Dispatch & Shipping Notice</h3>
          <p>Orders are typically dispatched within <em>14</em> business days after receiving full delivery details.
            Delivery may occasionally be faster or slower due to various factors; however, I will strive to process and
            send orders as soon as possible. While I cannot guarantee exact dispatch times, I will keep the buyer
            informed about the status of their order.

            If the package has not been dispatched within 30 business days, the buyer has the right to request a refund.
            Please note that refunds are not automatic and will only be issued upon such a request and after appropriate
            review.

            I am not responsible for any delays or losses once the package has been handed over to the delivery
            provider. Tracking information may be provided when available.</p>

          <p>
            This policy is intended to provide transparency and fairness to both
            parties. By making a purchase, you confirm that you have read and accepted
            all terms above.
