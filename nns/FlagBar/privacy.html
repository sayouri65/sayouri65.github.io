                <p>
                    The <strong>FlagBar</strong> extension <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit</strong> any
                    personal data.
                    It does not use trackers, cookies, analytics tools, or external scripts that might access your
                    activity.

                <h2>2. How Does FlagBar Work?</h2>
                <p>
                    FlagBar operates entirely in your browser. It modifies visual elements on selected websites
                    (e.g., YouTube‚Äôs progress bar) using identity flag color schemes (e.g., transgender, lesbian,
                    bisexual).

                <h2>3. Website Access and Permissions</h2>

                <h3>Host Permissions</h3>
                <p>
                    FlagBar requires access to specific sites like <code>https://www.youtube.com/*</code> to apply
                    visual changes.
                    It does <strong>not</strong> read content or browsing history ‚Äî only CSS is modified.
                </p>

                <h3>Storage Permission</h3>
                <p>
                    Used solely to remember the selected pride flag for YouTube. Preferences are stored locally and
                    never shared.

                    allowed the extension to be shared more
